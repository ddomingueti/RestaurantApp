# RestaurantApp
A study on ASP .NetCore 6.0


<h2>What is this about?</h2>
The intent of this repository is only to study about the new features of ASP .NetCore 6. The goal is an IFood like application (or a local shop app), in which the client can select the products he want, do the payment and receive it at home. I've chosen the MVC pattern, since it is simple and it is also possible to create an RestfullAPI from the code base.

I should upload some diagrams about the entire application as well in the future.

<h2>About contribuitions</h2>
I won't be accepting external contribuitions since my goal is to learn the tool correctly :)
